- Set SameSite on Auth0 cookie if possible
- Add http errors to redux slices to help with troubleshooting network errors
- Redirect to an error page from a Thunk in case of critical errors from which we cannot recovered
- Switch to using eslint.config.js when the ESLint extension better supports it
